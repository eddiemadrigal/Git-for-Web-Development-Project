37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
To understand the Lambda git flow, we need to think of files and folders as objects that have different stages of development associated with each of them.  Lambda has a repo on GitHub.  We need a copy of it, so we fork to our GitHub account.  Then, we need to clone that repo to our local machine so we can do work on the repo on our computers.  Before directly working on the master copy (branch), we should first create a branch that is not the master so that if we make a mistake, the mistake is done on a branch and not on the original cloan (the master).  When we are done editing a file on our branch, we can then push that branch to our GitHub account.  This will allow us to share with reviewers, collaborators, etc. our work. Once all of the edits have been made and we are satisfied with the non-master branch, we can request a pull our branch to our master on OUR GitHub repo.
